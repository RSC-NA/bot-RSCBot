# RSCBot: teamManager

The `teamManager` cog is primarily responsible for managing franchises, thier teams, and tiers.

## Installation

The `teamManager` cog has no other cog dependancies.

```
<p>cog install RSCBot teamManager
<p>load teamManager
```

## Usage

Franchises and tiers must be created before any teams may be added. The `transactions` cog is responsible for adding and removing players from teams.

- `<p>addFranchise <gm> <franchise_prefix> <franchise name>`
  - Creates a new franchise in the discord server:
    - Adds a prefix association between `gm` and `franchise_prefix`
    - Adds a discord role for the franchise in the correct format: [<franchise_name> (<gm_name>)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/679698891129880580/707975741505273938/Capture.PNG)
    - Updates GM details
      - Adds GM role
      - Updates Nickname to include prefix (`<franchise_prefix> | <GM name>`)

## What if a GM changes?

If a GM wishes to step down, or leaves the server, the prefix and the franchise role name must be updated.
- Coming Soon: `<p>transferFranchise`
- Until this addition is made, franchises may be recovered or transferred with commands from the `prefixManager` cog. (See [prefixManager docs](https://github.com/adammast/RSCBot/tree/master/prefixManager))
