# RSCBot: combineRooms

The `combineRooms` cog is primarily responsible for managing combines for RSC. This involves dynamically creating and deleting voice channels under a "Combine Rooms" category. This cog uses discord events to keep rooms open for each tier that has been established.

## Installation

The `combineRooms` cog has no other cog dependancies.

```
<p>cog install RSCBot combineRooms
<p>load combineRooms
```

## Usage

- `<p>startCombines`
  Creates a Combine Rooms channel category with all associated text and voice channels.

- `<p>stopCombines`
  Runs a teardown for all combine channels. This will remove all channels under the "Combine Rooms" categorty as well as the category itself.

## Customization

- `<p>setRoomCapacity` (Default: 10)
  - Sets the limit for discord members in room.
- `<p>togglePublicity` (Default: Public)
