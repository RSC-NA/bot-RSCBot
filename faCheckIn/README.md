# RSCBot: faCheckIn

The `faCheckIn` cog is primarily responsible for helping manage Free Agent substitutions. This cog allows for Free Agents to check in or check out to indicate availability for substitution. Teams who need a substitute may check availability for free agents at a given tier.

## Installation

The `faCheckIn` cog has no other cog dependancies.

```
<p>cog install RSCBot faCheckIn
<p>load faCheckIn
```
